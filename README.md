# Inventory-Sorter

Kinda updated to 1.18_experimental-snapshot-7

Didn't see the 1.17 branch, so this is based of an older version!
I made only the most necessary changes to use it while testing the snapshot w/ a few friends.

Bugs:
- Sorting of chests via button only executes the "sort" command (anyway it sorts the chest c:)
- Icon in the inventory is broken (bcs of gradle settings)
- Playerheads won't be sorted correctly
